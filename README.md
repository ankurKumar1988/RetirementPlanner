# RetirementPlanner
A light-weight program to plan savings for retirement. 
You can put in the basic details about your income and savings and then 'compute'
your total savings upon retirement with graphical plot of your savings over the years.
You can also save your favorite retirement plans/savings schemes (this feature will be added in the next version).
